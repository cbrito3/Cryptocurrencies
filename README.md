# Cryptocurrencies

Background

For this challenge we are creating a report and analysis that addresses what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The initial data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, we will use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm, followed by data visualizations, such as tables, 3-D scatter plot and hvplot.scatter plot, to share the findings.
